This is a small program to run simulations of the secretary problem (http://goo.gl/DkwzRL)

If it works as expected you should find that you get the optimal stopping point
~37% of the time regardless of how many "applicants".

Rather than have secretaries I'll be using random ints between 1 and INT_MAX.
This just makes it easy to objectively rank "applicants" against each other and
see how often we pick the best secretary.
